It seems that the repository `Simple-Hotel-Booking-GUI` is not accessible or has been removed, which is causing the issue. However, I can provide a general README structure for how to run a Java GUI-based project, which you can modify based on the actual contents of your project.

Here's a **README** template that you can use:
